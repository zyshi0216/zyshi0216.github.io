[DOI:10.1109/JSEN.2023.3346880](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10380540)
<br>
- In this paper, a wearable device is designed for table tennis players. It enables the recognition and evaluation of athletes' professional movement skills. It is mainly based on pattern recognition technology to realise the recognition of athletes' movement skills, and at the same time assesses athletes' movement skills based on a hierarchical evaluation system. It uses artificial intelligence technology to achieve the functions of monitoring recognition and skill assessment of athletes' motor skills.
